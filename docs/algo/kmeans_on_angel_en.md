# KMeans

> KMeans is a method that aims to cluster data in K groups of equal variance. The conventional KMeans algorithm has performance bottleneck; when implemented with PS，however, KMeans achieves the same level of accuracy with better performance.

## 1. Introduction 

The KMeans algorithm assigns each data point to its *nearest* cluster, where the *distance* is measured between the data point and the cluster's *centroid*. In general, Kmeans algorithm is implemented in an iterative way as shown below:  

![kmeans](../img/kmeans.png)   

where, ![xi](../img/xi.png) is the ith sample and ![ci](../img/ci.png) is its nearest cluster; ![miu_j](../img/miu_j.png) is the centroid of the ith cluster. 


## Mini-batch KMeans
"Web-Scale K-Means Clustering" proposes a improved KMeans algorithm to address the latency, scalability and sparsity requirements in user-facing web applications, using mini-batch optimization for training. As shown below:

## 2. Distributed Implementation on Angel

### Model Storage
KMeans on Angel stores the K centroids on ParameterServer，using a K×N matrix representation, where K is the number of clusters and N is the data dimension，i.e. number of features. 

### Model Updating
KMeans on Angel is trained in an iterative fashion; during each iteration, the centroids are updated by mini-batch. 

### Algorithm
